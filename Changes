Release 0.02
  * Fixed a bug that caused most of the data in the INFO field to be ignored.
  * Now the full INFO field for the captured frame is being included.
  * The Device::TNC::KISS module can now read frames from a raw KISS log file.
  * The FCS bits at the end of AX.25 frames are not present in the frames I
  collect using my TNC-X. Thus I cannot parse this data and return it in the
  structure returned by read_ax25_frame for now the field has been removed.

Release 0.01
  * Initial creation.
  * Has been tested with a TNC-X under Linux (2.6.16 kernel) and Windows 2000.
  * There is a bug on Windows where the KISS TNC doesn't open properly for some
  reason. To work around this I've found that if you connect to the TNC using
  UI-View and the quite UI-View the TNC can be used after that. I have not been
  able to track down the cause of this issue however.

This is the README file for the Perl module Device::TNC

What does Device::TNC provide?

The module Device::TNC provides the basis of a generic set of modules that can
be used to interface with a Terminal Node Controller (TNC).
The subclass module has been developed to talk to KISS mode TNC's.

What's a TNC?

If you don't know then this module probably won't interest you.
A TNC provides an interface between radio communication and the user.
In some cases this is via a display on the TNC but in other cases this is simply
a connection to a serial port on a computer.
The serial port could be an RS232 connection, a USB to Serial adaptor or a USB
conneciton with a software defined serial port.

The initial versions of this module have been developed on Linux and Windows 
2000 with a KISS mode TNC (TNC-X).
It is hoped (but not guarenteed) that this module will have been developed in
such a way as it's easily extended for use with other TNC's.
I expect the API to change as people subclass this module to work with other
TNC's.
If you do this sort of thing please let me know so that I can assist with your
development work and any re-design that may (probably will) be necessary.

Installation

Installation follows the usual Perl module installation procedure.

perl Makefile.PL
make
